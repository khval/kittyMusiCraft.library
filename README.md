# kittyMusiCraft.library
This is an extension for Amos Kittens

This is basically a skeleton extension.
All commands are included, but they will return an error, if you try to using any of the commands.
If you don’t install the extension Amos Kittens will ignore the command, and try to run the program.
So, unless you’re interested in contributing to this project, you most likely should not install it.
