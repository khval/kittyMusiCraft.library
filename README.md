# Not included

No copyrighted text or source code or manuals are included from orginal, I have no right to original work. and clime no legal right to distribute the original 680x0 assembler source code. I do not endorse piracy, if you can try obtain it legally, if possible, I know many do distribute abandonware, thatâ€™s purely at there own risk.

The legality of this, is similar to Pepsi Cola, ReactOS, AROS or WINE.
This code is not based on reverse engineered code, its purely based on the development documentation, and guess work.
